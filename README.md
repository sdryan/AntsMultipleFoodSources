# AntsMultipleFoodSources
Repository for Matlab Codes used in the paper by Hartman et al. "Walk this Way: ..."


1. The Matlab file "ant_depositon_..." was used to do the linear stability analysis of Eq. 4 in the manuscript.
2. The Matlab file "ants_master_eqn..." was use to simulate the macroscopic PDE Eq. 2 in the manuscript and produce density plots for foragers, carrying ants, and the phermone concentration.
3. The Matlab file "ants_latticecode_SR_onefoodsource.m" was used to simulate the lattice model with a single food source.
4. The Matlab file "ants_latticecode_SR_twofoodsources.m" was used to simulate the lattice model with two equidistance food sources.
5. The Matlab file "ants_latticecode_SR_twofoodsources_ne.m" was used to simulate the lattice model with two non-equidistance food sources.
